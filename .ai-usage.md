# AI Usage Log

I used AI (Mostly ChatGPT) during this project **only as a productivity helper** to speed up repetitive or boilerplate tasks.  
All architectural decisions, state management patterns, and final implementations were made by me.

## What AI Helped With
- **Boilerplate / Initialization**
  - Base Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript setup.
  - Example configs for `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, Tailwind v4 tokens.
- **Reusable UI Components**
  - Skeleton code for generic components like `Button.vue`, `Input.vue`, `Select.vue`.
  - I refined styling, variants, and interaction details myself.
- **Documentation**
  - Drafted parts of this `README.md` and this `.ai-usage.md` file.
  - I reviewed and edited to match my own explanations and decisions.
- **Unit Test**
  - Help me covering unit test


## What I Did Manually
- Defined the overall **folder structure** and project architecture.
- Designed **state management strategy** (Pinia store shape, caching, URL-driven state).
- Built **job-specific components** (`JobCard`, `JobSummaryCard`, `JobSectionCard`) and business logic.
- Decided when components should be **generic vs specific**.
- Implemented **i18n integration**, **error handling**, **404/empty states**, and **production proxy strategy**.
- Finalized **performance optimizations** (caching, lazy imports, route-driven state).

## Note
AI was not used to generate the entire solution â€” it was a **pair programmer** to speed up scaffolding.  
All code was reviewed, adapted, and tested by me before committing.
